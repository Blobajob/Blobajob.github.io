    								Hi, my name is Blob, I'm the Tea Guru. I've been drinking tea for as long as I can remember.


                  <p class="text-lg">

                    "Yeah, times were tough back then. All I could think about is where my next tea was going to come from.
                    When you're in that frame of mind, you'll do anything and I did things I'm not proud of, not gonna lie, but I'm a changed man now. If you'd have told me 5 years ago that I'd be using phrases like 'Big Data', 'Content is King' and 'Customer Journey',
                     excuse my language but I would have probably told you to go fuck yourself" - Blob, the Tea Guru, 2018
                  </p>
                  <p class="small">
                    Tea is a drug, let's face it. There's no denying that it can tear people's lives apart. It can and it does!! Been there, done that, got the proverbial T-shirt.
                    There were days when I'd get up and drink 4 cups before even setting foot in work. Then at work, I'd constantly be in the kitchen making cups of tea. Folk would roll their eyes.
                      One day I got dragged into my manager's office and he told me I'd have to clean up my act or I'd be out the door.
                      I was mortified. I went home that night determined to change my ways but within an hour, I was drinking a cup of tea with 4 malted milk biscuits watching the One Show. Old habits you see.
                      I started crying my eyes out when I realised that I couldn't help myself. I'd hit rock bottom but something changed in me that night. I found the resolve to take a new path. I quit my job, got some counselling, cleaned myself up
                      and went on to do a PhD in the Nueroscience of tea drinking as well as several courses on tea tasting, which I exceled at by the way. I'd regained control
                      over my addiction but I'd also turned into somewhat of a connoisseur. I now drink as few as 35 cups a day, which I never thought I'd hear myself say. This experience fuelled me to go on a new journey to help people that find themselves in a similar predicament.
                      It felt like a mission that I needed to fulfill. And with that, the Tea Guru was born. I know it seems contradictory to think that on the one hand, I'm encouraging people to drink tea and on the other hand, I'm trying to wean them off it and in some ways it is.
                      I've had people call me a fraud, a hypocrite and an exploiter. And sure, I am all of those things and more but you have to make hay while the sun shines.

                      The war rages on with builders and the Tea Guru. In a recent interview, the Tea Guru apparently said that he "takes pity on their desensitised palates".
